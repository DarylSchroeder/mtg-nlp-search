# ðŸš€ Path to Done: From MVP â†’ Full-Stack Web Application

## Overview
Build a complete MTG NLP Search web application with FastAPI backend and modern frontend that allows users to search Magic: The Gathering cards using natural language.

## Current Status: Step 1 âœ… â†’ Step 2 ðŸš§

---

## 1. Backend API Foundation âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… FastAPI service with /search endpoint
- âœ… Natural language query parsing ("2 mana instant" â†’ "cmc:2 type:instant")
- âœ… Scryfall API integration with proper rate limiting and headers
- âœ… Error handling and graceful fallback when OpenAI quota exceeded
- âœ… Structured JSON responses with card data
- âœ… Basic logging and monitoring

## 2. Backend Enhancement & Production Readiness (Current Stage)
- âœ… Add `python-dotenv` to load .env
- âœ… Improve parsing resilience (handle GPT responses gracefully)
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite (pytest)
- [ ] Add input validation with Pydantic models
- [ ] Fix deprecated OpenAI API usage
- [ ] Add caching layer (Redis or simple LRU)
- [ ] Add TCGPlayer price lookup for card pricing
- [ ] Add deployment configuration (Docker, proper requirements.txt)
- [ ] Add health checks and monitoring endpoints

## 3. Frontend Development
- [ ] Choose frontend framework (React, Vue, or vanilla JS)
- [ ] Create responsive UI for card search
- [ ] Implement search interface with autocomplete
- [ ] Design card display components with images
- [ ] Add advanced search filters (color, type, mana cost, etc.)
- [ ] Implement search history and favorites
- [ ] Add mobile-responsive design

## 4. Full-Stack Integration
- [ ] Set up CORS for frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Implement proper API error handling in frontend
- [ ] Add loading states and user feedback
- [ ] Optimize API calls and implement client-side caching
- [ ] Add search analytics and usage tracking

## 5. Deployment & Hosting
- [ ] Set up production database (if needed for user features)
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Deploy backend (AWS Lambda, EC2, or container service)
- [ ] Deploy frontend (Netlify, Vercel, or S3 + CloudFront)
- [ ] Set up domain and SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging

## 6. Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] User accounts and authentication
- [ ] Deck building functionality
- [ ] Card collection tracking
- [ ] Price alerts and watchlists
- [ ] Advanced search with boolean operators
- [ ] Card comparison tools
- [ ] Integration with other MTG APIs (EDHREC, MTGTop8)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Immediate Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Backend Stability)
1. **Add comprehensive test suite** - Unit tests for query parsing, API endpoints
2. **Add input validation** - Pydantic models for request/response validation  
3. **Fix deprecated OpenAI API usage** - Update to latest OpenAI client patterns
4. **Add deployment configuration** - Docker, proper requirements.txt, health checks

### Medium Priority (Backend Enhancement)
5. **Add caching layer** - Redis or simple LRU for Scryfall responses
6. **Add TCGPlayer price lookup** - Enrich card data with pricing information
7. **Improve query parsing** - Handle more complex natural language patterns

### Next Phase (Frontend Development)
8. **Choose and set up frontend framework** - React/Vue/vanilla JS
9. **Create basic search interface** - Input field, results display
10. **Implement card display components** - Show card images, details, pricing

## Example Queries to Test
- "Find a 2 mana instant that counters spells"
- "Show me red creatures with power 4 or greater that cost 3 mana"
- "I need a planeswalker that can draw cards and costs less than 5 mana"
- "Find artifacts that can tap for mana and have converted mana cost 2"
- "Show me blue counterspells that cost 1 mana"
